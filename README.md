This is a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System built using React.js and Tailwind CSS. The application provides a simple yet powerful way to manage users, roles, and permissions within a web-based environment. It also includes user authentication features such as signup and login functionality. The system allows administrators to assign roles to users, manage their status, and define permissions for each role.

Key Features
1. User Management
View and Manage Users: Easily view and manage a list of users in the application.
Add, Edit, or Delete Users: Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing users.
Role Assignment: Assign roles to users to define their access level.
User Status Management: Toggle user status between Active and Inactive, ensuring proper user access control.
2. Role Management
Create and Edit Roles: Define new roles or modify existing ones to suit your systemâ€™s needs.
Role Permissions: Roles can be configured with specific permissions such as Read, Write, and Delete, or customized attributes based on the system's requirements.
3. Dynamic Permissions
Assign or Modify Permissions: Easily modify or assign permissions to different roles using a simple and intuitive interface.
Clear Permissions Display: Permissions for each role are clearly displayed and can be modified to ensure easy understanding and accurate role configurations.
4. Custom API Simulation (Optional)
Mock API Calls: Simulate API calls for CRUD operations on users and roles without a real backend, using tools like JSON Server or similar.
Simulated Server Responses: Responses from the simulated API are designed to mimic real-world server interactions, validating the functionality of the system.
5. Authentication
User Signup/Registration: Users can sign up for a new account by providing their details (email, username, and password).
Login/Logout: Registered users can log in to the system and access the role-based features.
Technologies Used
React.js: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for designing a responsive and modern UI.
React Router: For handling navigation between different views in the application.
Mock API (JSON Server): Simulates backend API calls to handle CRUD operations for users and roles.
